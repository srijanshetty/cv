I was bored with all the boring templates out there and hence this template came into existence.
Behold my CV.

I don't know how to create .sty files yet, so you'll have to make do with the defined environments.

# Dependencies

- Fonts
  Install Fontin which has been bundled with this package

# Instructions

- The following should work proviso you have all the dependencies listed above.

```shell
xelatex cv
```

- I like to use pdf2htmlEX to create a gh-pages branch with the HTML version of the PDF.
  Additionally I have a post-commit hook which automatically generates the HTML version.
  (You need to copy the contents of pdf2htmlEX to /usr/share/pdf2htmlEX for a good html
  version to be renedered).

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [[ $branch == "master" ]]; then
    xelatex cv
    git checkout gh-pages
    pdf2htmlEX --process-outline 0 --zoom 1.6 cv.pdf
    mv cv.html index.html
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "Update to Website"
    git push origin gh-pages
    git checkout master
fi
```

# FAQ's

- What's in it?
  Different environments for my Frankenstein use-cases.
  If you think my design sense is bad, you're probably thinking right.

- Where's the documentation?
  Le documentation. I shall add more as soon as I get the time (read never).

# Attribution

This template takes elements from the Alessandro Plasmati's resume template but has been heavily modified
to my aesthetic sensibilities (which more often than not might be bad).
